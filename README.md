## Screen 1:
+ Provides an input field and a button with text 'Submit'.
+ User can input any value in the input field.
+ Clicking on the button redirects the user to screen 2.
+ If the input field is empty or has only space characters, an alert is shown asking the user to provide a non-empty value. In this scenario, the user is not redirected to screen 2.

## Screen 2:
+ Iterates over each character of the string and renders them as a card on the UI.
+ Each card has the character and a delete icon on top
+ Clicking on the delete icon deletes all duplicate instances of the chosen character in the string. Only the clicked instance of the character remains on the screen.
+ Cards for the same characters have the same background color.
+ If there are no more characters with greater than 1 appearance in the string, a success header is rendered.
+ The original string and the new resultant string are shown.
+ A back button is provided to go back to screen 1.
+ If the user goes back to screen 1, the input field is cleared/empty.

## The app üñ•Ô∏è takes care of all the edge cases mentioned in the assignment üìã
+ It deletes all duplicates, regardless of capitalization, by converting all input characters to uppercase during processing.
+ The app can handle any non-alphabetic characters, including special characters, as input and perform operations on them.
+ It can remove leading and trailing spaces from input and automatically delete extra spaces between two words when the submit button is clicked.
+ When deleting a long string with multiple words, if a word is deleted in the middle of the process, it will automatically remove the extra space to avoid having two spaces between words.
+ Also, the mobile view is taken care of using media queries.

## Enhancements
+ when the input string is large the mobile UI doesnt look too good 
+ if the app has extra functionalities we can create routes for each function
+ I intentionally treadted all characters as Uppercase beasue in sentence no matter what case the character it gives same value in a string to do this I added another algo dor it if its not needed We can remove that by this all uppercase and lower case can be distinguied.
